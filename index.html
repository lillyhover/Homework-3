        I am Lilly Hover, a third-year Data Science and Economics student at Northeastern University. 
        I am originally from Dallas, Texas, but spent three years living overseas in Thailand where I learned 
        about myself, the world, and what I want to do with my life. Living in Thailand taught me empathy 
        and appreciation. My experiences there followed me to Boston, sparking my passion for equity and education. 
        At Northeastern, my life experiences have been catalysts for my different involvements on campus. 
        Here I am the President of an undergraduate research journal called ECONPress. I have helped undergraduate students 
        from all over the world have their work published, focusing on bringing attention to global economic crises
        that usually go unmentioned. I lead my team in publishing others but also in creating weekly newsletters
        where we turn bigger news stories into more digestible content for the student body to make news more accessible 
        for busy students that would skip over important stories otherwise. 
        I am also the Vice President of the Chi Omega Fraternity, where I oversee scholarship, 
        education, and chapter morale. Education is a privilege and I am dedicated to teaching others, as well as offering
        them academic support however I can. <a href="page2.html">Learn more about my life here!</a>
