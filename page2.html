            <p>What do we do?</p>
            <ul class="A">
                <li><b>Annual Journal</b></li>
                <p>
                    Each Spring in ECONPress, we publish an annual journal. This has been a practice since the club was founded
                    in 2009. The journal showcases 4-6 undergraduate papers on vast topics. The journal gives opportunities to 
                    undergraduate students from all over the world to have their writing published by a Northeastern University
                    endorsed journal, and to be hosted on a stable website. We post the journals on social media, host them on our website,
                    and print hard copies of the journal to be distributed by Northeastern. The journal is carefully crafted by our 
                    team of hardworking and experienced editors over the course of the school year. 
                </p>
                <li><b>Weekly Newsletters</b></li>
                <p>
                    Every week, we send out a Newsletter containing 3-5 short articles written by members of ECONPress. This is how 
                    we give our own members opportunities to have their writing published and sent out to the student body. Newsletter
                    blurbs are short 150-200 word analyses of articles chosen by our team. Members are encouraged to write about topics 
                    that interest them that they feel the world should pay more attention to. 
                </p>
                <li><b>Podcast</b></li>
                <p>
                    We are in the process of expanding our horizons to create a podcast. We have a team working each week to come up with
                    podcast ideas based on real-world issues and data from students here at Northeastern.

            <p>What do we do?</p>
            <ul class="A">
                <li><b>Scholarship Opportunities</b></li>
                <p>
                    The Chi Omega Fraternity hosts a long list of scholarship opportunities for its members throughout the calendar year. 
                    Scholarships are awarded to members who meet certain criteria. They are usually specific scholarships intended to help
                    members in need. There are currently scholarship opportunities to help members who have been affected by the devastating 
                    natural disasters that have occurred in the past few months.
                </p>
                <li><b>Parliamentary Work</b></li>
                <p>
                    At Northeastern, I provide academic support to members of my Fraternity and act as the chapter parliamentarian. 
                    In the Spring, I was tasked with revising our chapter Bylaws and Standing Rules. I changed them to make them more accessible 
                    for members who do not have access to certain luxuries, ensuring that the Fraternity is fair for all regardless of 
                    socioeconomic status. 
                </p>
                <li><b>Chapter Events</b></li>
                <p>
                    I am also tasked with planning and hosting events for the chapter. Each week, I hold Study Hours for the Fraternity. 
                    Study Hours are an opportunity to provide members with a space on campus to work on any projects they have, whether it
                    is for school or their personal life.
